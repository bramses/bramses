**_today_**

As of Fall 2024, Bram is actively working on two intertwined missions: the foundation and formalizations of the [core philosophies of personal library science](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40192359), and writing the initial software that powers it: **[Your Commonbase](https://bramses.notion.site/Your-Commonbase-BETA-10b034182ddd8038b9ffe11cc2833713)** (A Self Organizing Screpbook with Zero Stress Storing, Searching, and Sharing). 

**_other projects and experiences include_**

Bram is the creator of [Stenography](https://stenography.dev), an API and [VSC Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Stenography.stenography) that automatically documents code on save, which went **[#1 on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/stenography#stenography)**. He also created [MapGPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-Pw20OIj6o-mapgpt), a GPT that creates a personalized tour guide from anywhere in the world and has been a featured GPT on the GPT Store and used in more than **one hundred thousand conversations**. He also is the author of [Bramses' Highly Opinionated Vault](https://github.com/bramses/bramses-highly-opinionated-vault-2023), an extremely detailed philosophy + vault template used by **thousands of Obsidian users** (new and old!), and [ChatGPT MD](https://github.com/bramses/chatgpt-md), a (nearly) seemless integration of Chat GPT into Obsidian which has been downloaded by over **thirty thousand Obsidian users**. He also taught the [GPT-3 in Production Course for O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/live-events/gpt-3-in-production/0636920065944/0636920071443/), teaching students how to leverage LLMs in the real world of production.

Previously Developer Advocate @ [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/), Software Engineer @ [HBO](https://www.hbo.com/), Computer Science B.S. @ [University of Rochester](https://rochester.edu/)
