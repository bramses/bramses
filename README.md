* [You Will Be Fragmented](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bramadams.dev&#x2F;you-will-be-fragmented&#x2F;) - When an artist dies young there is always talk of the paintings unpainted, the books unwritten, which points to some imaginary storehouse of undone things and not to the imagination itself, the far richer treasure, lost.
* [The Neutral Roach](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bramadams.dev&#x2F;the-neutral-roach&#x2F;) - Anything that ever was white is not white here. That is not a color you see. Even a white flower opening up on a bush just looks doomed for this world.
* [From Toca to Trocars](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bramadams.dev&#x2F;from-toca-to-trocars&#x2F;) - Hostility overwhelmed me. It’s more than just not liking roaches: I don’t want them.
* [Silence Has Many Advantages](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bramadams.dev&#x2F;silence-has-many-advantages&#x2F;) - This book is like any other book. But I would be happy if it were only read by people whose souls are already formed.
