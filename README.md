As of Fall 2023, Bram is actively working on [Commonplace Bot](https://github.com/bramses/commonplace-bot), a novel and modern look into how LLMs and creative coding can help us capture, engage, and creatively remix the best pieces of information we come across.

He also taught the [GPT-3 in Production Course for O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/live-events/gpt-3-in-production/0636920065944/0636920071443/), teaching students how to leverage LLMs in the real world of production.
