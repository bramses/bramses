As of Summer 2024, Bram is actively working on two intertwined missions: the foundation and formalizations of the [core philosophies of personal library science](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40192359), and writing the initial software that powers it: your Commonbase (Commonplace Book + LLM Augmented Database). [Commonplace Bot](https://github.com/bramses/commonplace-bot) and its sibling projects: [Quoordinates](https://github.com/bramses/quoordinates) and [Quo-Host](https://github.com/bramses/quo-host), are the world's first look into what he future of reading books and retention will look like with the influence of LLMs. You can test Commonplace Bot out live in the Bram Adams' [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GrgkFP3Je3). 

The **active work prototypes** for general Commonbase build can be found in the prototype libraries [Commonbase Editor Prototype](https://github.com/bramses/commonbase-editor-prototype-quill) and [Commonbase Prototype](https://github.com/bramses/commonbase-prototype).

**_other projects and experiences include_**

Bram is the creator of [Stenography](https://stenography.dev), an API and [VSC Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Stenography.stenography) that automatically documents code on save, which went [#1 on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/stenography#stenography). He also created [MapGPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-Pw20OIj6o-mapgpt), a GPT that creates a personalized tour guide from anywhere in the world and has been a featured GPT on the GPT Store and used in more than fifty thousand conversations. He also is the author of [Bramses' Highly Opinionated Vault](https://github.com/bramses/bramses-highly-opinionated-vault-2023), an extremely detailed philosophy + vault template used by thousands of Obsidian users (new and old!), and [ChatGPT MD](https://github.com/bramses/chatgpt-md), a (nearly) seemless integration of Chat GPT into Obsidian which has been downloaded by over thirty thousand Obsidian users. He also taught the [GPT-3 in Production Course for O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/live-events/gpt-3-in-production/0636920065944/0636920071443/), teaching students how to leverage LLMs in the real world of production.
